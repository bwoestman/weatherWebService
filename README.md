# weatherWebService
Web service to get and organize weather stats.

## Problem Statement

Many weather web services return massive amounts of data when you request from their url.  The data would be easier to use if it were organized into a weekly report instead of separate requests to obtain the data.  Our service will make the requests necessary to generate a weekly weather report.
