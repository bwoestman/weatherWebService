* BW - this week I created a class to organize a nested json so that we could sort the incoming data and generate our own, smaller, json.
* NS - Week 11/12 I added a unit testing for weather.java, added error handling in case the service is down, added some info for team presentation.
* JM - finished writing most of the tests for coverage. Trying to figure out how to log tests to one file and log info request info to another. Trying to build url from properties class is not working so well. We are doing this to try and seperate the api key from the full url. Looks like a no go
