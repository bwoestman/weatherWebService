* BW - this week in class I explained how to use Postman to do requests, fixed some merge conflicts, added a couple tests that deal with converting json to gson & worked through some package problems from git pushes.
* JM - I created a property class to get the informatino form instead of hard-coding values in the application. Started to work on creating test for all the classes.
